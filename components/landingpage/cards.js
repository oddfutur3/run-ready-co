What began as an alignment in views from Nick and Rob on ensuring runners understood their bodies and how they move when they run, has become a path forward into evolving a system to truly evaluate a runners movement and match to exactly the right footwear and exercise programming.",

From programming our assessment protocols to building the organization and functions around a massive shoe database, right through to how we administer an exercise program for runners of all types, the RunReady tech team, led by Larry Lau, has to understand a vast array of scenarios and applications for RunReady while ensuring it is user friendly and scalable. Not a small task by any stretch.
